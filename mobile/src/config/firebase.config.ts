 * - iOS: ios/GoogleService-Info.plist
 *
 * These files contain the platform-specific appIds and are downloaded
 * from Firebase Console when you register each app.
 *
 * This config object is kept for reference only and is NOT used by
 * React Native Firebase. The native config files handle everything.
